# Release Tools

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/upfrontIO/release-tools.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

The release tools are a bunch of command line tools to maintain a release. These tools are usually used by a release manager.

## Usage

These utilities are provided by this [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@livingdocs/release-tools).

After adding it as dev-dependency to the NPM package you are working on, you will be able to execute `li-release` on the command line to see all available commands. Every command shows some help about a function executed without arguments, e.g. `li-release init-release`.




## Examples

- [How to Handle a Product Release on Github](./doc/how-to-handle-a-product-release-on-github.md)


## Run the tests
